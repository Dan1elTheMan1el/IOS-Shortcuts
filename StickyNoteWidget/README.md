**Customizable sticky notes on your home screen with no other apps!**

# Sticky Note Widget

This is based on my much older shortcut [Sticky Note](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9942/), but is rewritten for easier use and updated to work with a widget.

## Features
- Full markdown support
- Customizable text/note color, font size
- Save favorite color combo
- Over 1500+ Fonts
- Add images to note

## How to use
*After you create your first note, a popup with visual instructions will appear.*

1. Customize font/size
2. Enter note markdown
3. Choose note color (or quick note)
4. (Optional) Add images to note
5. (First time) Add a photo album widget to your home screen, and change its album to newly created **StickyNote**


### Demo markdown:

```
# Title
---
## Subtitle
**bold** *italics*
`print("code block")`
- lists

(Full markdown support)
```
